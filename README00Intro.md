# Atari-Breakout76 INTRODUCTION

**INTRODUCTION**:

According to Wikipedia ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)), the Breakout arcade game was conceived at Atari by Nolan Bushnell and Steve Bristow.  A working prototype was built by Steve Wozniak. (Steve Job's role was to steal Wozniak's fair share of the bonus for reducing the design's chip count.)  Steve Wozniak's highly optimal design was clever to the point that Atari was unable to modify it to add the coin slot control needed for an arcade game.  So, Atari went with their own design using more chips.  Per Steve Wozniak the final game appeared to work the same as his design.

An important fact here is that Breakout is a very early arcade game built from digital logic chips.  There is no CPU, no program executing, so no source code.  Therefore any programmable system is only simualting the behaviors.  I have no Breakout system of my own, and even if I did I have inadequate electronics background to dissect the electronics.  This limits me to guesses from watching how the game behaves in pictures and videos on the internet.
