# Atari-Breakout76 AUDIO

**AUDIO**:

So far three apparent sounds ....

| Object  | Sound Pitch |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Paddle  | High        | 
| Borders | Medium      | 
| Bricks  | Low         | 

It doesn't seem to be impact to a brick that triggers the sound.  
Rather, it is the score counter increment that initiates sound.  
One strike on a Yellow Brick cause one tone for one point added to the score.  
One strike on a Red Brick causes the game to add 7 points to the score, and then it plays 7 tones.
