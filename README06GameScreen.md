# Atari-Breakout76 Game Screen

**GAME SCREEN**

The details of Game Screen arrangment:



================ WIP
  The minimum grid for a usable character glyph is 3x5 pixels.  A happy medium will be used.  Stylistically, the first and last columns of pixels will be doubled.  The text will occupy six scan lines from the top of the font.  The center line (i.e "H, F, E, B, P, A" etc. horizontal bar) will be the third scan line.  The seventh line will be blank, and the 8th will be solid maintaining the bottom of the horizontal border. This will make characters about 6 pixels wide including the blank column to separate letters.  The characters will be rendered non-proportionally, so rather than "P", "L", "A", "Y" glyphs in the characters "P", L", "A" and "Y" respectively, the glyphs will be written into several sequential custom characters placed as a group.. (e.g. the characters "RST" would contain the images for "PLAY".)
