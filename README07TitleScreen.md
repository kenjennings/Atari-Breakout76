# Atari-Breakout76 Title Screen

**TITLE SCREEN**

I am so tempted to embellish this to stupid extremes, but that is the intention for Breakout-GECE.  (Control!  You must learn control!  -Yoda)

So, the Title Screen is just a simple place to park for managing simple configuration settings, and provide a tolerably minimum amount of credits and directions.
