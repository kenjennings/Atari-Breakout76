# Atari-Breakout76
Currently Work In Progress..

Simple Breakout clone approximating the look and feel of the original arcade Breakout released by Atari in 1976.

This version uses only the Atari features necessary to achieve the correct look and behavior with as few extraneous bells and whistles as possible.

Or, you could just get MAME and emulate the original game.
