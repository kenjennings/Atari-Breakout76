# Atari-Breakout76
Simple Breakout clone trying to approximate the original look and feel of arcade Breakout released by Atari in 1976.

This version uses only the Atari features necessary to achieve the correct look and behavior with as few extraneous bells and whistles as possible.

Currently Work In Progress.
